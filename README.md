# GreyBand App & Marketing UI – Design Portfolio

This repository showcases selected UI/UX work I contributed to for **GreyBand**, a wearable alcohol-tracking device and companion mobile app developed by GreySun Technologies. My work focused on creating Figma UI layouts for both the mobile app experience and the corresponding marketing / crowdfunding pages.

## Project Overview
GreyBand is a wearable breathalyzer that connects to a mobile app to help users track alcohol intake and receive safety-focused feedback. I worked on the **UI design**, **layout**, and **visual presentation** for various app screens and the web-facing launch content.

This repo includes exported frames from the Figma file and screenshots of layouts I helped implement.
