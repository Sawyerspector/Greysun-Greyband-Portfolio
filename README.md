# GreyBand App & Marketing UI – Design Portfolio

This repository showcases selected UI/UX work I contributed to for **GreyBand**, a wearable alcohol-tracking device and companion mobile app developed by GreySun Technologies. My work focused on creating Figma UI layouts for both the mobile experience and the marketing / crowdfunding pages.

## Project Overview
GreyBand is a wearable breathalyzer that connects to a mobile app to help users track alcohol intake and receive safety-focused feedback. I contributed to the **UI design**, **layout**, and **visual presentation** for key app flows as well as sections of the product’s public-facing launch pages.

This repo contains **external links** to the Figma design file and Indiegogo page where the live layouts can be viewed.
